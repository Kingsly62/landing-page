      <h3>Why Programming?</h3><br>
      Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. Humans need to be able to control the interaction between people and machines.<br> Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately, we use computer programming to harness that computing power.<br>
      Programming is everywhere in the modern world and meets you in the street, your workplace,<br> and the local grocery store and supermarkets.<br> You interact with bar-code scanners regularly, and you almost certainly use lots of code<br> while working, whether you're using a word processor to <br>write a letter or an email platform to send messages.<br><br>
